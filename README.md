# Anticipating-per-capita-CO2-emission-trajectories
This project implements a fully reproducible machine-learning pipeline to analyse and predict country-level trajectories of per capita CO₂ emissions. The workflow combines data preparation, dimensionality reduction and supervised models, with a strong emphasis on modularity, temporal validation and reproducibility.
